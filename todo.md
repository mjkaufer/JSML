# Todo

* Unit tests
* Support for nested tags between content
	* E.g. `<p>Hello <b>World</b> ABC</p>`
* Better package integration
	* Usability as a command line argument, e.g. `jsml -c [file]`
* Incorporate into express, similar to Jade, so compiling is done by the server
* Sublime plugin with syntax highlighting
